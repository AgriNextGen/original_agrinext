# P0 Verification Report (placeholder)

This document will be generated by the P0 test harness after execution. It will contain:

- Seed run results (created users and IDs)
- Flow run results per role: PASS / FAIL with errors and stack traces
- Minimal SQL fixes applied (if any) and the migration file used
- Recommendations and next steps

Run the harness:

1. Populate `tests/p0/.env` from `.env.example` with service role key and anon key.
2. Install deps: `cd tests/p0 && npm ci`
3. Seed users: `npm run seed`
4. Run flows: `npm run run`

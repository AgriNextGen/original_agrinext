## 1. What This App Is

AgriNext Gen is a **multi-role agricultural supply-chain platform** for Karnataka (India), connecting:

| Role | Key Responsibility | Route Prefix |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| `farmer` | Crop records, listings, transport requests | `/farmer/*` |
| `agent` | Field verification, task management, farmer assignments | `/agent/*` |
| `logistics` | Accept loads, execute trips with proof | `/logistics/*` |
| `buyer` | Browse listings, place market orders | `/marketplace/*` |
| `admin` | Monitoring, data health, ops governance | `/admin/*` |
| `vendor` | Supplies agricultural inputs (fertilizer, seeds, pesticides) | `/vendor/*` (future) |

> Vendor dashboard is planned but not yet implemented.

Region: Karnataka, India. Primary language: Kannada + English (bilingual). Phone-first UX (PWA, low-bandwidth).

### 1.1 Platform Philosophy

This platform is **NOT a marketplace** — it is a **coordination infrastructure**.

The goal is to optimise system-wide outcomes:

- Reduce post-harvest losses
- Stabilise prices through predictive coordination
- Increase logistics efficiency (load aggregation, reverse logistics)
- Improve farmer income via direct market access

AI agents must preserve this philosophy. Features should coordinate actors and optimise the network, not simply list products for sale.

**Long-term vision:** AgriNext aims to become *the operating system of agricultural logistics* — a predictive coordination network connecting farms, markets, and supply chains across rural India.

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite 5, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| State | TanStack Query v5 (React Query) + Dexie IndexedDB (offline) |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres 17, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage) |
| Edge Functions | Deno runtime, jsr imports |
| Routing | React Router v6 |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod |
| i18n | Custom hook (`useLanguage`) + `src/i18n/en.ts` / `src/i18n/kn.ts` |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Maps | Google Maps JS API Loader |
| Payments | Razorpay |
| AI | Google Gemini (via `supabase/functions/ai-gateway`) + ElevenLabs TTS |

---

## 3. Auth System (Phone-First — CRITICAL)

### How it works

- Users sign up via **phone + password** (NOT email). Email is **never real**.
- Synthetic email format: `91XXXXXXXXXX@agrinext.local` (derived from phone number).
- Auth is handled entirely by Edge Functions `signup-by-phone` and `login-by-phone`.
- JWT is issued by Supabase Auth after Edge Function validates credentials.
- **Never use `supabase.auth.signUp()` with email on the frontend** — all auth goes through Edge Functions.

### Auth context (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`)

```ts
const { user, session, userRole, realRole, activeRole, isDevOverride } = useAuth();
```

- `userRole` — legacy field used across the app; equals `activeRole` when override is active
- `realRole` — canonical role from `profiles` / `user_roles` table (never overridden)
- `activeRole` — what the app treats as the current role (may differ in dev)
- `isDevOverride` — true when a dev acting session is active

### Dev Role Switching (never in production)

- Edge functions `dev-switch-role` / `dev-get-active-role` allow switching roles without new accounts.
- Requires `VITE_DEV_TOOLS_ENABLED=true` + `x-dev-secret` header.
- Sessions expire in 8 hours. Stored in `dev_acting_sessions` table.

## 4. Database Architecture (Multi-Schema)

### Schema Groups

| Schema | Purpose | Who Accesses |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `public` | All operational app data | Frontend via anon key + RLS |
| `secure` | Tier-4 regulated data (KYC, financials, payments) | Edge Functions only (service_role) |
| `analytics` | Aggregated reporting, BI | Admin Edge Functions + read replicas |

### ABSOLUTE RULES — Never Break These

1. **Never expose `service_role` key to frontend** — only Edge Functions use it.
2. **All tables must have RLS enabled** — no exceptions.
3. **All state transitions must go through RPC or Edge Functions** — never raw `.update()` for state fields.
4. **Tier-4 data stays in `secure` schema** — KYC docs, payment details, settlement data.
5. **All sensitive actions must write audit logs** — append-only, never delete.
6. **No destructive migrations** — always `ALTER`, never `DROP` on production data columns.

### Key Tables in `public` Schema

```
profiles               -- user display info, language preference
user_roles             -- role assignment per user
agent_farmer_assignments -- which agent covers which farmers
farmlands              -- farmer land parcels
crops                  -- crop records (linked to farmland)
crop_activity_logs     -- append-only crop event log
listings               -- produce listings for marketplace
transport_requests     -- farmer requests for transport
trips                  -- logistics trip execution
trip_location_events   -- GPS events during trip (partitioned)
transport_status_events -- state machine events for transport
vehicles               -- transporter vehicle registry
market_orders          -- buyer purchase orders
notifications          -- in-app notifications
rate_limits            -- API abuse prevention
```

### Standard Column Pattern
Every table must have:
```sql
id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
created_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now()
updated_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now()
```

### 4.1 Logistics Domain Model (Target State)

Logistics is treated as a **predictive network problem**, not simple point-to-point delivery. The following domain entities define the target-state logistics engine. Some exist in the DB today (`trips`, `transport_requests`, `vehicles`); others are planned extensions.

#### Domain Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `ShipmentRequest` | Logistics demand from any actor (farmer, buyer, vendor, admin) | Planned — currently `transport_requests` covers farmer-only |
| `ShipmentItems` | Line items inside a shipment | Planned |
| `LoadPool` | Grouped shipments from multiple actors for shared transport | Planned |
| `Trip` | Vehicle trip execution | **Exists** (`trips` table) |
| `TripLeg` | Individual stops inside a multi-stop trip | Planned |
| `VehicleCapacityBlock` | Remaining capacity on a vehicle for a trip | Planned |
| `ReverseLoadCandidate` | Return-trip shipment opportunity | Planned |
| `Booking` | Shipment assigned to a specific trip | Planned |

#### Reverse Logistics Principle

Vehicles are **round-trip assets**. Every trip has two legs:

- **Forward:** Village → Market (produce)
- **Return:** Market → Village (fertilizer, seeds, inputs, goods)

AI agents must always consider reverse logistics when designing trip-related features. Never model vehicles as one-way assets.

#### Engine Services (Target Architecture)

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| `LogisticsOrchestratorService` | Shipment creation, load pooling, trip generation |
| `TripManagementService` | Trip lifecycle, trip legs, capacity tracking |
| `ReverseLogisticsService` | Detecting return trips, matching reverse loads |

These services should be implemented as modular backend services or Edge Functions. Domain logic must not leak into controllers or UI components.

---

## 5. RLS Rules (Summary)

- Farmers see only their own `farmlands`, `crops`, `listings`, `transport_requests`
- Agents see only their assigned farmers (via `agent_farmer_assignments`)
- Logistics see only trips assigned to their user/vehicle
- Buyers see only approved listings and their own `market_orders`
- Admin has read access to everything but all write actions must be audited
- **Use RLS helper functions** like `auth.uid()` and `get_current_profile_id()` — do not embed user IDs in queries

Full RLS matrix: `docs/all_imp_rules/ENTERPRISE_RLS_POLICY_MATRIX.md`

---

## 6. Edge Functions (20 Deployed)

Runtime: Deno. Imports: `jsr:` prefix. All in `supabase/functions/`.

Shared utilities available at `supabase/functions/_shared/`:

| Utility | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `cors.ts` | Standard CORS headers |
| `errors.ts` | Typed error classes, standard error response format |
| `env.ts` | Safe environment variable loading |
| `request_context.ts` | JWT parsing, user ID extraction |
| `gemini_client.ts` | Google Gemini API client |
| `ai_context.ts` | Builds structured context for AI prompts |
| `ai_prompts.ts` | Prompt templates (farmer, agent, logistics) |
| `ai_lang.ts` | Language-aware AI response formatting |
| `ai_response.ts` | Standardised AI response formatter |

**Always check `_shared/` before writing new utilities in a function.**

### Function Catalog

| Function | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `signup-by-phone` | No JWT | User registration (phone + password) |
| `login-by-phone` | No JWT | Phone auth with rate limiting + lockout |
| `storage-sign-upload-v1` | JWT | Generate signed URL for private storage upload |
| `storage-sign-read-v1` | JWT | Generate signed URL for private storage read |
| `get-weather` | JWT | Weather data for farmer location |
| `tts-elevenlabs` | JWT | Text-to-speech via ElevenLabs |
| `ai-gateway` | JWT | Routes AI requests to Gemini; rate-limited |
| `create-payment-order` | JWT | Create Razorpay payment order |
| `payment-webhook` | No JWT (HMAC sig) | Razorpay payment event webhook |
| `job-worker` | No JWT (secret header) | Background async job processor |
| `finance-cron` | No JWT (cron) | Scheduled finance tasks |
| `finance-reconcile` | No JWT (custom auth) | Payment reconciliation |
| `finance-admin-api` | No JWT (custom auth) | Finance admin operations |
| `admin-enqueue` | JWT | Admin enqueues background jobs |
| `admin-jobs-summary` | JWT | Admin job statistics |
| `admin-finance-summary` | JWT | Admin financial summary |
| `dev-switch-role` | JWT | DEV ONLY: Switch acting role |
| `dev-get-active-role` | JWT | DEV ONLY: Query active role |
| `dev-create-acting-session` | JWT | DEV ONLY: Create acting session |
| `dev-revoke-acting-session` | JWT | DEV ONLY: Revoke acting session |

### Edge Function Standard Response Format
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable" } }
```
Use `successResponse()` and `errorResponse()` from `_shared/errors.ts`.
Full standard: `docs/all_imp_rules/API_CONTRACTS.md` Section 2.

### 6.1 API Design Rules

All APIs (Edge Functions, RPCs, future REST endpoints) must be **role-agnostic**. Shipments, trips, and bookings are created by multiple actor types — the API layer must not couple to a single role.

**Do this:**
```
POST /shipments          — any actor creates a shipment
GET  /shipments/{id}     — filtered by RLS
POST /trips              — orchestrator creates trips
GET  /trips/{id}         — filtered by RLS
POST /bookings           — assign shipment to trip
```

**Do NOT do this:**
```
POST /farmer-logistics-only
POST /buyer-only-shipment
GET  /admin-trips
```

Role-based access control is enforced at the RLS and JWT layer, not at the endpoint naming layer. This keeps the API surface clean and extensible as new roles (e.g., vendor) are added.

## 8. i18n Pattern

**Always add keys to BOTH files simultaneously.** Never add to one without the other.

```ts
// In a component:
const { t } = useLanguage();
return <span>{t('farmer.dashboard.title')}</span>;

// In src/i18n/en.ts:
farmer: { dashboard: { title: 'My Dashboard' } }

// In src/i18n/kn.ts:
farmer: { dashboard: { title: 'ನನ್ನ ಡ್ಯಾಶ್‌ಬೋರ್ಡ್' } }
```

The translation engine auto-detects mojibake (corrupted Kannada) and attempts UTF-8 recovery. Dev warnings fire for missing keys.

---

## 9. React Query Pattern

- All data fetching uses `useQuery` / `useMutation` from TanStack Query.
- Query keys follow the pattern: `['entity', 'action', ...params]`
- Offline: React Query cache is persisted to IndexedDB via `src/offline/queryPersister.ts`
- **Never use `useEffect` + `fetch` for data — always use React Query.**

```ts
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['crops', farmerId],
  queryFn: () => supabase.from('crops').select('*').eq('farmer_id', farmerId),
});
```

---

## 10. Migration Rules

### Naming Convention
```
YYYYMMDDHHmm_descriptive_name.sql
Example: 202603071003_p1b_fix_crop_diary_null_defaults.sql
```

### Severity Prefixes
- `p0_` = Critical security/crash fix
- `p1a_` / `p1b_` = High priority bug fix
- `phase_` / `stage_` = Feature phase migration

### Rules
1. **Never DROP** a production column — use `ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT` + backfill NULLs instead.
2. **Always backfill NULLs** before adding a NOT NULL constraint.
3. **Add DEFAULT before NOT NULL** — two separate steps.
4. **One migration per logical change** — don't bundle unrelated changes.
5. **Test with `supabase db reset`** locally before pushing.

### Nullable Column Pattern (critical pitfall)
```sql
-- Step 1: backfill existing NULLs
UPDATE crops SET health_status = 'normal' WHERE health_status IS NULL;
UPDATE crops SET growth_stage = 'seedling' WHERE growth_stage IS NULL;

-- Step 2: set DEFAULT (so new rows never get NULL)
ALTER TABLE crops ALTER COLUMN health_status SET DEFAULT 'normal';
ALTER TABLE crops ALTER COLUMN growth_stage SET DEFAULT 'seedling';

-- Step 3 (optional): add NOT NULL if needed
ALTER TABLE crops ALTER COLUMN health_status SET NOT NULL;
```

---

## 11. Known Pitfalls (CRITICAL — Read Before Touching These Areas)

### Pitfall 1: `strictNullChecks` is OFF
`tsconfig.app.json` has `"strictNullChecks": false`. This means TypeScript will **not** warn you about null/undefined access. You must manually null-check anything from the DB.

```ts
// BAD — will crash at runtime if healthStatus is null
const icon = healthStatusConfig[crop.health_status].icon;

// GOOD
const icon = healthStatusConfig[crop.health_status ?? 'normal'].icon;
```

### Pitfall 2: `crops.health_status` and `crops.growth_stage` are nullable
These columns were added without defaults. Old rows may have NULL. Always use `?? 'fallback'`.
- `health_status ?? 'normal'`
- `growth_stage ?? 'seedling'`
Fixed in migration `202603071003_p1b_fix_crop_diary_null_defaults.sql` but still apply defensively.

### Pitfall 3: Auth uses phone, not email
`supabase.auth.signUp({ email })` should **never** be called from the frontend for real auth. Use `login-by-phone` / `signup-by-phone` Edge Functions.

### Pitfall 4: `types.ts` is auto-generated (257KB)
`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` is regenerated by `supabase gen types`. **Never edit it manually.** Run `supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to regenerate.

### Pitfall 5: No ErrorBoundary on most pages
Most pages don't have React ErrorBoundary. A single null access in a component tree causes a blank page. Always null-check values from DB queries.

### Pitfall 6: Dual lock files
Both `package-lock.json` (npm) and `bun.lockb` (bun) exist. Use `npm` for all package operations — the CI/CD pipeline uses npm.

---

## 12. Component Conventions

- **One component per file.** File name = component name (PascalCase).
- **Hooks are in `src/hooks/`**, not inside component files.
- **Domain components** go in their role folder (`farmer/`, `agent/`, etc.).
- **Shared cross-role components** go in `src/components/shared/`.
- **Never edit `src/components/ui/`** — these are shadcn/ui auto-generated.
- **Always use `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts`** for conditional Tailwind classes.

### Adding a New Page
1. Create `src/pages/{role}/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `src/App.tsx` inside the role's `<Routes>` section
3. Add route constant in `src/lib/routes.ts`
4. Add nav link in the role's sidebar/nav component
5. Add i18n keys to `src/i18n/en.ts` + `src/i18n/kn.ts`

### Adding a New Feature with DB Changes
1. Create migration: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHmm_feature_name.sql`
2. Run `supabase db reset` locally to verify
3. Regenerate types: `supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
4. Implement hook in `src/hooks/`
5. Implement UI component + page
6. Deploy: `supabase db push` then `supabase functions deploy {function}` if needed

---

## 13. Commit Message Convention

**Format:** `type(scope): short description`

| Type | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `migration` | DB migration |
| `chore` | Config, tooling, cleanup |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code restructure (no behavior change) |
| `test` | Test files |
| `security` | Security fix |

**Examples:**
```
feat(farmer): add crop diary photo gallery
fix(crop-diary): null healthStatus crash on blank health_status column
migration: p1b fix crop diary null defaults
security(rls): enable RLS on 18 missing tables
chore: remove deprecated backend/ directory
```

**Do NOT use:** "new imp", "new update", "bug fix", "fix", "changes" — these are meaningless for git blame.

---

## 16. Scalability Constraints

The platform must scale to serve:

- **Millions** of farmers across Karnataka and eventually other states
- **Thousands** of transport partners and vehicles
- **Large logistics networks** with multi-stop, multi-actor coordination

Design choices must prioritise:

- **Horizontal scalability** — stateless Edge Functions, no server-side sessions
- **Async processing** — use `job-worker` and background queues for heavy operations (load pooling, route optimisation, reconciliation)
- **Partitioned data** — `trip_location_events` is already partitioned; apply the same pattern to high-volume tables as they grow
- **Offline-first** — rural connectivity is unreliable; all farmer-facing flows must work offline via IndexedDB + action queue

---

## 17. What NOT to Do (AI Safety Rules)

- Do NOT call Supabase from Edge Functions with the **anon key** — use service_role for server-side DB writes.
- Do NOT add `.select('*')` on tables with sensitive columns — be explicit.
- Do NOT skip RLS on new tables — `ALTER TABLE x ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is mandatory.
- Do NOT use string literals for routes in new code — use `ROUTES` constants from `src/lib/routes.ts`.
- Do NOT modify `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` manually — always regenerate.
- Do NOT commit to `main` directly — always use a feature branch.
- Do NOT add raw `console.log` with user data — use structured logging.
- Do NOT build role-specific API endpoints — use unified, role-agnostic endpoints with RLS for access control.
- Do NOT model vehicles as one-way assets — always consider reverse logistics.
